Part 1 - Printing Practice
Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen:
**Remember you must exit() python interpreter before running a script!!!

    Expression                                      Expected Output                               Did anything unexpected happen?
a)  print("1")                                      1                                               no
b)  print(1)                                        1                                               no
c)  print(1 + 2)                                    3                                               no
d)  print("1" + "2")                                3                                               yes
e)  print("this" + " " + "is" + " " +               error                                           no
    "a" + " " +
    "sentence" + ".")

Part 2 - Variables Practice
1. In your Console
Type and run the following:
    animal = "dogs"                                 idk                                             yes
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following:
    1. What happens?                                it says dogs are really cool.                    no
    2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead?    Make it start again and say animal = "cat" then ask the question again and it should say cats are cool.
2. In your Console
Type and run the following code:
print(dogs + " are cool.")                          
In your Notebook
Respond to the following questions:
    1. What output does this produce?                       It says error and dogs arent defined
    2. Why does this happen?                                Because we didnt say dogs = anything
